# Date Wave

## **Overview**

The Date Wave application is designed to facilitate the exchange of messages between various applications such as IoT Hub, Event Hub, Service Bus, MQTT, and Kafka. The application is currently capable of sending and receiving messages from these services, and in the future, there may be more services added to the list. This feature can be beneficial during the development process as it allows for basic testing of services and applications

The Date Wave application also enables users to prepare messages using pre-defined templates and send them periodically or at specific time intervals. Additionally, the application can consume messages from the aforementioned services and display them, providing users with a way to view the messages being received by the application. Overall, the Date Wave application is a valuable tool for facilitating message exchange and monitoring during the development process.

## **Placeholders**

Placeholders allow you to customize your message templates with custom content when sending data to services. To generate placeholders for all placeholders present in the message/header/properties section, click on the "Generate" button. Make sure to use double curly braces to represent a placeholder in your template.

Here's an example message template:

```
{
  "NodeId": "{{NodeId}}",
  "ApplicationUri": "{{ApplicationUri}}",
  "DisplayName": "{{DisplayName}}",
  "Value": {
    "StatusCode": {
      "Symbol": "{{Symbol}}",
      "Code": "{{Code}}"
    },
    "SourceTimestamp": "{{SourceTimestamp}}"
  }
}
```
After clicking on the generate button, the placeholder section on the right side of the screen will show all the placeholders generated for the placeholders in the template.

```
NodeId
ApplicationUri
DisplayName
Symbol
Code
SourceTimestamp
```
then you can see the section like below generated with all placeholders with string random as the placeholder filling method

![Message Explorer](./images/ss_genplaceholders.jpg)

You can change the placeholder generation method by selecting the respective option from the dropdown. You can find the available options below.

Once you click on the preview button, you can see how the placeholders will prepare the message for you. Here's an example of the default sample:

```
{
  "NodeId": "LEqRZts4j",
  "ApplicationUri": "h1eTcA",
  "DisplayName": "2eQKT",
  "Value": {
    "StatusCode": {
      "Symbol": "ZojTDysL",
      "Code": "dU5orT4vl"
    },
