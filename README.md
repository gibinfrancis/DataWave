# Data Wave

## Overview

The Date Wave application is designed to facilitate the exchange of messages between various applications such as IoT Hub, Event Hub, Service Bus, MQTT, and Kafka. The application is currently capable of sending and receiving messages from these services, and in the future, there may be more services added to the list. This feature can be beneficial during the development process as it allows for basic testing of services and applications

The Date Wave application also enables users to prepare messages using pre-defined templates and send them periodically or at specific time intervals. Additionally, the application can consume messages from the aforementioned services and display them, providing users with a way to view the messages being received by the application. Overall, the Date Wave application is a valuable tool for facilitating message exchange and monitoring during the development process.
